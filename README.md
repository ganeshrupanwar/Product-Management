## Overview

This project was created as part of an SDE assignment to build a full-stack-like CRM front-end using React, Redux, and dummy REST APIs. It includes:

- A **Login Page** with form validation and toast notifications.  
- **Authentication** via public/private routing guards.  
- A **Dashboard** with summary cards and interactive charts.  
- **Product Management**: full CRUD operations with search, sorting, and pagination.

## Features

- **Login & Authentication**: Protected routes ensure only authenticated users access the dashboard and products page.  
- **Dashboard**:  
  - Summary cards showing total products, average price, and average rating.  
  - Line chart and bar chart visualizing product data.  
- **Product Management**:  
  - Add, edit, and delete products using a styled form with inline validation.  
  - Client-side search, sortable columns, and pagination in the product list table.  
- **Responsive Design**: Hamburger menu on mobile, adaptable card layouts.  
- **State Management**: Implemented with Redux Toolkit and React-Redux.  
- **Form Handling**: Built with Formik and Yup for validation.  
- **Notifications**: Success/error toasts using react-toastify.
